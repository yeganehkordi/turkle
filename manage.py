    #   python manage.py runserver
    # If Django is started as a WSGI process, it will not serve static files.

    # Official warning from documentation about the --insecure flag:
    #
    #   Use the --insecure option to force serving of static files
    #   with the staticfiles app even if the DEBUG setting is
    #   False. By using this you acknowledge the fact that it's
    #   grossly inefficient and probably insecure. This is only
    #   intended for local development, should never be used in
    #   production and is only available if the staticfiles app is in
    #   your project's INSTALLED_APPS setting. runserver --insecure
    #   doesn't work with CachedStaticFilesStorage.
